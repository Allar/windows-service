# windows-service

This is a header only library that allows you to quickly write a Windows Service by using a simple interface. It is also structured according to https://github.com/robotology/how-to-export-cpp-library#-other-template-and-examples.

This is a fork from a MIT licensed windows-service template created by Mikko Saarinki and located here https://github.com/Kingston1/windows-service.

This fork attempts to make this repo into something that can be used by other CMake projects easily with the following:

```
@TODO:
```

# Example

An example on how to use this Windows Service library can be found at @todo

# Important

I forked and made this repo so I can easily write Windows Services without understanding how to write a Windows Service and completely abstract this away from myself. I have no idea about the implementation details and am really not qualified to maintain this repo. Please raise issues and pull requests if you're you could be so inclined.

# TODO

* Document how to use this
* Add notification tray icon support
* Write meaningful tests
* Set up CI stuff
